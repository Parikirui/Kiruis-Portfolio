At the primary school level, my main academic rival was Maribel De la Fuenthe.</br> While Maribel dreamt of becoming an aerospace engineer, I dreamt of becoming a <em>software engineer.</em> </br>Later on, I attended Maseno University for my Bachelors degree in Information Technology. I graduated in the with <span>Second Class Honors, Upper Division.</span>.</br>I have experience in both hardware and software troubleshooting. I gained this experience while working as an IT intern at The County Govt of Tranzoia.</br>I also worked as an IT Supervisor in the 2019 census exercise.I joined Moringa School to sharpen my dreams of becoming an Artificial Inteligence Engineer.</br>My hobbies are reading, writing, and swimming</p>
